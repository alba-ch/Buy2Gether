## Background 
This project has been developed as a project of Integrated Software Project subject at my Computer Science course.

## Technologies

### Languages
To develop the project, we have used:
- Java

### Software
To code the app for Android, we worked with **IntelliJ**, and to design the UI/UX mockup, **Adobe XD**, because it allowed us to create a good looking mockup very quickly using plugins.

## Structure
- **doc**: Documentation and diagrams
- **model**: Logical functions
- **provider**: Firebase and preferences
- **usecases**: Layouts
